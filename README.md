**Welcome to my Github Portfolio**

# AnneFein.github.io
Here I will showcase, in my projects, my ever evolving experience with various programming languages, including JavaScript ES6, HTML, and CSS.

**How to Run**

This website runs in a web browser.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

I plan to create a few of my own personal projects and add them to GitHub. I currently have a "Personal Projects - Coming Soon!" section in my "My Projects" dropdown menu, as a placeholder.
I commented out the Search Bar code, because it doesn't currently have functionality. I will uncomment these lines if and when I do add functionality to the Search Bar.
