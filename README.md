**Welcome to my Github Portfolio**

# AnneFein.github.io
Here I will showcase, in my projects, my ever evolving experience with various programming languages, including JavaScript ES6, HTML, and CSS.

**How to Run**

This website runs in a web browser.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

I plan to create a few of my own personal projects, and to add them to GitHub. I will add the link to my "Personal Projects - Coming Soon!" section of my "My Projects" dropdown menu.
I commented out the Search Bar code, because it doesn't currently have functionality. I will uncomment these lines if and when I do add functionality to the Search Bar.
I plan to revise my video, to include more information about me, and to list more of the experience that I will have, as I move through the MITxPRO course.
