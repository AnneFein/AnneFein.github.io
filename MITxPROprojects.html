    <h1>My MITxPRO Projects</h1>
    <p>I created the following projects on GitHub, through the MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding. These projects demonstrate my experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

    <h2>PacMen Exercise</h2>
    <p>This exercise simulates a PacMan moving horizontally across the computer screen, and opening and closing its mouth. The PacMan image changes direction once it hits the edge of the screen, and repeats the process once it hits the opposite edge of the screen. There are four rotating images, which simulate the PacMan opening and closing its mouth.</p>

    <h2>Eye Exercise</h2>
    <p>This exercise uses an .onmousemove event to simulate the movement of two eyes, when a mouse is moved over them on the screen. The eyes will follow the direction of the mouse, in any direction.</p>

    <h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
    <p>View buses moving on Route 1, near MIT and Harvard, in real time. This project takes the bus locations from the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) website, and marks them on a map from Google Maps.</p>
